 five main page we are developing will share some commmon viewmodels as components:
1.search page - where users can customize pet profile to be viewed
2.browse page - where users can read a pet profile
3.favpet page - where users can see the pet they have liked
4.mypet page- where users if are petowner certified can edit petprofiles
5.myprofile page - where users can edit their own information


in the bottom of our app, we will always have 5 panels that help users to redirect to other pages.
Instead of rewriting all the codes in each main page, we will define these viewmodels here so each main page will just
be a  viewmodel that contains all of the viewmodel that it need.
