CSC207 Project

Project Domain:
Every year, approximately 6.3million pets are surrendered to shelters in the US- and nearly 1 million euthanized. The challenge our team aims to address is creating a rendezvous that helps people who are looking to become pet owners find deserving pets in need of homes- in a familiar swiping style. This will allow users to browse through profiles of pets, swiping right to express interest and left to move on to the next one. Users can set preferences based on factors like pet type (dogs, cats, etcâ€¦), personality, and age. The app will provide profiles for each pet, created by users registered as a shelter, including photos, descriptions, or adoption information. To build the app, we will use an API that generates pictures of cats just as a placeholder. 

API DOCU: https://developers.thecatapi.com/view-account/ylX4blBYT9FaoVd6OhvR?report=bOoHBz-8t 

TRYING OUT THE API: This particular call searches for limit=10 cat pictures, which is returned in JSON format
